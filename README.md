GitHub Action for `cargo install` with cache.

This installs the specified crate using `cargo install` and caches the installed binaries using [actions/cache].
If binaries for the specified crate are already cached, restore the cache instead of calling `cargo install`.

This was originally intended for installing crates that are not supported by [install-action].
For performance and robustness, we recommend using [install-action] if the tool is supported by [install-action].

## Usage

### Inputs

| Name   | Required | Description                                                                | Type    | Default |
| ------ |:--------:| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| tool   | **true** | Crate to install                                                           | String  |         |
| locked | false    | Use `--locked` flag                                                        | Boolean | true    |
| git    | false    | Install from the specified Git URL (see [action.yml](action.yml) for more) | String  |         |
| tag    | false    | Tag to use when installing from git                                        | String  |         |
| rev    | false    | Specific commit to use when installing from git                            | String  |         |

### Example workflow

To install the latest version:

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v1
  with:
    tool: cargo-hack
```

To install a specific version, use `@version` syntax:

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v1
  with:
    tool: cargo-hack@0.5.24
```

You can also omit patch version.
(You can also omit the minor version if the major version is 1 or greater.)

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v1
  with:
    tool: cargo-hack@0.5
```

## Migrate from/to install-action

This action provides an interface compatible with [install-action].

Therefore, migrating from/to [install-action] is usually just a change of action to be used. (if the tool and version are supported by install-action or install-action's `binstall` fallback)

To migrate from this action to install-action:

```diff
- - uses: taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v1
+ - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
    with:
      tool: cargo-hack
```

To migrate from install-action to this action:

```diff
- - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
+ - uses: taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v1
    with:
      tool: cargo-hack
```

The interface of this action is a subset of the interface of [install-action], so note the following limitations when migrating from install-action to this action.

- install-action supports specifying multiple crates in a single action call, but this action does not.

  For example, in install-action, you can write:

  ```yaml
  - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
      with:
        tool: cargo-hack,cargo-minimal-versions
  ```

  In this action, you need to write:

  ```yaml
  - uses: taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v1
      with:
        tool: cargo-hack
  - uses: taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v1
      with:
        tool: cargo-minimal-versions
  ```

- install-action supports `@<tool_name>` shorthand, but this action does not.

## Compatibility

This action has been tested for GitHub-hosted runners (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) and containers (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Alma, Arch, Alpine).
To use this action in self-hosted runners or in containers, at least the following tools are required:

- bash
- GNU tar
- cargo
